.. warning::
    If you don't understand what we mean by dividers, fear not.

We mean dividers that divide text or sections of text
in the Python console, or anything you use the library for.
For example:

.. code-block:: Python

        Hello World!
    ---------------------
    Welcome to my library.

In this example, the line between the two sections would be the divider.
